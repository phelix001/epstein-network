# "The Invisible Man" Identified: Epstein Documents Reveal Coded Emails About Procuring "Girls"

**TL;DR:** "The Invisible Man" in the DOJ documents is almost certainly **Prince Andrew**. Emails show Ghislaine Maxwell coordinating with a Peruvian contact to arrange "2 legged sight seeing (read intelligent pretty fun and from good families)" for him. The contact asks "About the girls... how old is he?" to match appropriate "girls."

## Who is "The Invisible Man"?

The identity is revealed across documents EFTA00011437-11441:

* **Named "Andrew"** - Maxwell writes: "I just gave Andrew your telephone no."
* **British Royal** - At "Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family"
* **Left Royal Navy** - "I have left the RN"
* **Signs "A xxx"** - All emails signed "A xxx" or "Love you A xxx"
* **Requires discretion** - "He does not want to read about any trip in the papers"
* **"Very English sounding gentleman"** - Maxwell's description to Peru contact
* **Lost valet at young age** - "He had been with me since I was 2" (consistent with royal household)

**Conclusion:** This is **Prince Andrew, Duke of York**.

## The Emails Containing Innuendo

### Document 1: EFTA00011437 (August 16, 2001)

**From:** "The Invisible Man" to Ghislaine Maxwell

> *"I am up here at Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family. Activities take place all day and I am totally exhausted at the end of each day. **The Girls are completely shattered and I will have to give them an early night today as it is getting tiring splitting them up all the time!**"*
>
> *"How's LA? **Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?** Let me know when you are coming over..."*

**Analysis:** "Inappropriate friends" is a joking reference to the type of companions Maxwell procures.

### Document 2: EFTA00011440 (August 18, 2001)

**Maxwell's Reply:**

> *"So sorry to disappoint you, however the truth must be told. **I have only been able to find appropriate friends.** Will let you know about some church meetings on those dates"*
>
> *Kisses, Gx*

**Analysis:** Maxwell jokes back that she could only find "appropriate" friends - implying she usually finds "inappropriate" ones. "Church meetings" appears to be code.

### Document 3: EFTA00011441 (March 3, 2002) - THE SMOKING GUN

**Maxwell to Peru contact (Juanesteban Ganoza), forwarded to "Andrew":**

> *"I just gave Andrew your telephone no. He is interested in seeing the Nazca Lines. He can ride but it is not his favorite sport ie pass on the horses."*
>
> ***"Some sight seeing some 2 legged sight seeing (read intelligent pretty fun and from good families) and he will be very happy."***
>
> *"I know I can rely on you to show him a wonderful time and that you will only introduce him to friends that you can trust and rely on to be **friendly and discreet and fun**."*
>
> ***"He does not want to read about any trip in the papers whom or what he saw."***

**Analysis:**

* "2 legged sight seeing" = girls/women
* "intelligent pretty fun and from good families" = the type of girls to procure
* "discreet" = won't talk to press
* "does not want to read about any trip" = needs deniability

### Document 4: EFTA00011438 (February 28, 2002)

**"Andrew" to Maxwell:**

> *"As for girls well **I leave that entirely to you and Juan Estoban!**"*

**Peru Contact (Ganoza) to Maxwell:**

> ***"About the girls... how old is he? I doubt it that he will find someone here, but we can try."***

**Analysis:** This is the most damning line. Ganoza is asking the visitor's age to determine what age "girls" to provide. This is procurement coordination.
